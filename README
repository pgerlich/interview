### Setup ### 
After pulling down the repository, you'll want to install all of the node packages with:
' npm -i '

In order to make the sass files, you can do:
'make sass'
or
'make run-sass'

Where make run-sass will setup a watcher on changes to the sass files (for active development)

Similarly, to build the project, you can do:
'make build'
Which compiles sass, runs the linter, and builds the JS. Or you can do:
'make run'
Which will just build the JS and setup a watcher for JS changes (for active development)

With questions just reach out on the facebook group, or my email is paul@gerlich.io
